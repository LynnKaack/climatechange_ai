## Paper forthcoming
This paper is currently a work in progress.

## Areas of focus
We have categorized the areas in which we see machine learning playing a meaningful role in the fight against climate change. For example, education of women has been ranked as one of the top ten most impactful actions on climate change. While not all of the areas listed below will be discussed in the workshop, we aim to cover as many as possible through talks and posters. A more detailed examination of all these topics will be provided in a white paper currently underway by the organizers. This will be complementary to the workshop and is intended to provide concrete steps to attendees and other members of the community who wish to be involved in climate-positive action.

**Mitigation**
 - **Energy**: Smart grids, accelerated science for battery design and photovoltaic cells, wind flow modeling, variable renewable energy forecasting, turbine placement and management, emissions modeling
 - **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, telepresence
- **Architecture and cities**: Smart buildings, heating & cooling, reducing food waste
- **Industry**: Industrial robots, supply chain management, tracking hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), industrial demand response, natural gas leak detection
- **Sequestration**: Optimizing carbon-capture materials/methods, CO2 leak detection
 - **Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)**:  Farming robots, sensing/interpreting data for precision agriculture, tools for farm management, methane capture, plant-based foods, tracking deforestation, automated afforestation, carbon stock estimation
 
**Adaptation**
- **Climate models**: Fine-grained and multi-resolution models (higher spatial & temporal resolution), cross-domain interactions (e.g. atmospheric/coastal) and domain transfer, tracking ice
- **Societal impacts**: Effects on agriculture, natural resources (fisheries, forestry, etc.), climate-informed disease models, analysis of water systems (rain, rivers, deltas, dams), migration patterns, ecosystem monitoring
- **Extreme events**: Fire prediction and intervention, storm prediction, coastal engineering, lethal heat events

**Society**
- **Tools for individuals**: Cost/benefit analysis of personal power usage/renewables, impact calculation and recommendations, local resources (e.g. compost), voluntary carbon tax
- **Tools for cooperation and coordination**: Large-scale planning, aggregation of preferences, mechanism design / game theory, structural risk estimation and management
- **Education**: Personalized education, education of women
- **Data communication**: Visualization and data interpretation, news recommendation
- **Finance**: Cost/benefit analysis, financial instruments related to climate change, tools for climate-positive investment
